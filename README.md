Utilities for mac configurations:

.bash_profile is my default profile with configs
jEnv is configured on my machine to switch between java versions with aliases added in this profile - to switch only for the shell youre currently using
.mavenrc is used to switch java versions for maven when jEnv is used to change java versions.
